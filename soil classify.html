    <h2>
      Soil classification is the systematic categorization of soils based on
      their properties, characteristics, and relationships to each other.
      Various soil classification systems have been developed to organize and
      describe the diverse range of soils found worldwide. Here are some key
      points about soil classification:
    </h2>
    <p>
      USDA Soil Taxonomy: The USDA Soil Taxonomy is one of the most widely used
      soil classification systems globally, particularly in the United States.
      It categorizes soils into hierarchical groups based on observable soil
      properties such as texture, color, structure, and horizon arrangement
    </p>
    <p>
      World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB): The World Reference Base
      for Soil Resources is an international soil classification system
      developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
      Nations. It provides a framework for classifying soils based on diagnostic
      soil properties and processes, emphasizing soil genesis, morphology,
    </p>
    <p>
      Soil Orders: Soil orders represent the broadest level of soil
      classification in systems like USDA Soil Taxonomy. Each soil order
      reflects fundamental differences in soil properties, formation processes,
      and environmental conditions.
