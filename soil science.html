      Soil science is a multidisciplinary field that studies the formation,
      properties, classification, and management of soils, which are vital
      components of terrestrial ecosystems. Here are some key points to
      consider:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Formation: Soil formation, or pedogenesis, occurs through the weathering
      of parent materials (rocks and minerals) by physical, chemical, and
      biological processes over time. Factors influencing soil formation include
      climate, topography, organisms, parent material, and time (CLORPT).
    </p>
    <p>
      Composition: Soil consists of mineral particles, organic matter, water,
      and air. The mineral fraction comprises various particle sizes, including
      sand, silt, and clay, which determine soil texture.

      Organic matter, derived from plant and animal residues, contributes to
      soil fertility, structure, and moisture retention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Properties: Soil properties such as texture, structure, porosity,
      permeability, color, pH, and nutrient content influence its suitability
      for plant growth, water retention, drainage, and environmental functions.
      Understanding soil properties is essential for land use planning,
      agriculture, engineering, and environmental management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classification: Soils are classified into taxonomic units based on their
      properties, including color, texture, structure, and mineralogy, according
      to systems such as the USDA Soil Taxonomy or the World Reference Base for
      Soil Resources.

      Soil classification helps scientists and land managers communicate and
      interpret soil information effectively.
