    <h2>
      Certainly! Soil composition refers to the combination and proportions of
      different components that make up soil. These components include minerals,
      organic matter, water, and air. Here's a breakdown of each component:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mineral Particles: Minerals are the primary solid components of soil,
      derived from the weathering and breakdown of rocks and minerals over time.
      The mineral particles vary in size, with three main categories based on
      particle size: <br />
      Sand: The largest mineral particles, with diameters ranging from 0.05 to
      2.0 millimeters. Sandy soils have a gritty texture and typically drain
      water quickly. <br />
      Silt: Intermediate-sized particles, with diameters between 0.002 and 0.05
      millimeters. Silty soils have a smooth, flour-like texture and moderate
      water retention capacity. <br />
      Clay: The smallest mineral particles, with diameters less than 0.002
      millimeters. Clayey soils have a sticky, plastic texture and high water
      retention capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organic Matter: Organic matter consists of decomposed plant and animal
      residues, including roots, leaves, stems, and microbial biomass. It
      contributes to soil fertility, structure, moisture retention, nutrient
      cycling, and biological activity. Organic matter content varies widely
      among soils and influences soil properties such as color, texture, and
      structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water: Soil contains varying amounts of water, depending on factors such
      as precipitation, drainage, evaporation, and plant uptake. Water fills the
      pore spaces between soil particles, providing hydration to plants and soil
      organisms, facilitating nutrient transport, and influencing soil moisture
      levels, aeration, and drainage.
